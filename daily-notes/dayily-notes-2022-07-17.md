# Daily Notes 2022-07-07

Have only setup a development environment for the FRDM-K66F development kit on my work computer, will today look into setting up on my home computer. Home computer is a HP Z-book laptop running Windows 10.

## MCUXpresso IDE

Started out installing the MCUXpresso IDE, do not plan to use this in the future but should be a simple way to get started.

Downloaded MCUXpresso from [here](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE?#design-resources), alternatively use this [direct link](https://www.nxp.com/webapp/swlicensing/sso/downloadSoftware.sp?catid=MCUXPRESSO).

Took the 11.6.0 Windows version. As a side note there was also Linux version to choose from, which is good since I plan to migrate to Linux soon.

## Testing Blinky Project

Tested to run my existing Project 2 Blinky from within the MCUXpresso IDE.

First failure message was:

> **Missing MCU Settings**  
> Project frdmk66f_led_blinky has no MCU settings. Please install SDK SDK_2.x_FRDM-K66F to use this project.
