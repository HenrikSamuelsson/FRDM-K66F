# Getting Started

The FRDM-K66F board arrived with a quick reference paper leaflet describing the board and a guide on how to get started. Followed the guide to test that the board was in working condition.

1. Connected the board to a PC USB port using the micro-USB cable that came with the board. There are two micro-USB connectors on the board, the one between the ethernet connector and the push button SW1 was used.

2. The board is supposed to come with a "bubble level" demo that takes input from the on board accelerometer and signals tilt using the RGB LED. Keeping the board flat caused the LED to be turned off as expected. Tilting would cause green or red light but no blue as it said in the leaflet.

Result is that at least the accelerometer and the RGB LED seems to be functional on the board. Not seeing any blue light is believed to be due to outdated information in the printed leaflet.
